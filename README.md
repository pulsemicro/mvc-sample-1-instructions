# Pulse Microsystems MVC Sample Program #1 Instructions

Pulse Microsystems is looking for a strong C# developer with expert knowledge of MVC3 and/or MVC4 and HTML5 to help
build a new suite of browser-based applications for the embroidery and embellishment industry.

Completion of this sample program helps us identify which developers are good candidates.

## Instructions

Using ASP.NET MVC 3 or 4, C#, and HTML5, create a web application that allows:

* Selection of a "template".
* Changing properties of that "template".
* Saving the final data (template identifier + changed properties + user information) to persistent storage (file, database, etc.)

Include a readme.txt with any installation instructions and extra notes.

ZIP up the entire project and include it with your resume.

### Additional options for bonus points:

* "Realtime" visual updating of the template based on the changed properties
* Use [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR) for *anything*

## Requirements

* Please use Visual Studio 2010 or 2012. For this purpose, the free Express editions are as good as the enterprise editions. Visual Studio Express 2012 can be downloaded from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products).
* Use of Flash or Silverlight is not permitted. The application must be 100% browser-based (web server assisted) using HTML/HTML5. It must run in Internet Explorer 9/10.
* Use of Javascript libraries is permitted (such as jQuery, KnockoutJS, SignalR, etc.), even encouraged.
* Use of 3rd party libraries is permitted.Please document what 3rd party libraries were used so we know what is yours and what is not.

## FAQ

### What is a template?

A template can be anything you want it to be, as long as it has something that can be modified by the user.  

A simple example:

Allow your user to select from "Template 1", "Template 2", or "Template 3".

* Template 1 includes customizable options such as "First Name" and "Last Name"
* Template 2 includes customizable options such as "Home Town"
* Template 3 includes customizable options such as "Spouse's Name", "Kid's Name #1", "Kid's Name #2", etc.

### Can I submit my resume without a sample project?

You can, but including a sample project will have your resume looked at faster.

### Can I use other technologies instead of ASP.NET MVC, such as ASP.NET Web Forms, PHP, or Ruby?

No. Our projects will be built using MVC4, so we are looking for someone well versed in ASP.NET MVC.

### Can I post by sample application somewhere (such as Microsoft Azure) for you to see?

You can, and this will help us when executing your sample application. But we still want to see the source code.
